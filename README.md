# SOLID Principles with C#
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Although the SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies such as agile development or adaptive software development.

## Principles

| -------- | ------- |
| <span style="font-size:2em;">S</span>ingle-Responsibility Principle | A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job. <br/> [Learn More ...](SingleResponsibilityPrinciple/README.md) |
| <span style="font-size:2em;">O</span>pen-Closed Principle | Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. <br/> [Learn More ...](OpenClosedPrinciple/README.md)|
| <span style="font-size:2em;">L</span>iskov Substitution Principle | Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. <br/> [Learn More ...](LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple/README.md)|
| <span style="font-size:2em;">I</span>nterface Segregation Principle | A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use. <br/> [Learn More ...](InterfaceSegregationPrinciple/README.md) |
| <span style="font-size:2em;">D</span>ependency Inversion Principle | Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions. <br/> [Learn More ...](DependencyInversionPrinciple/README.md) |
